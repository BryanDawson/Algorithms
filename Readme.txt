This repo contains projects exploring various "well known"
algorithms.  This continues my "code every day" challenge,
but with 'harder' problems that will often more than one
day to complete.

Note: I will generally refer to the available references
for good solutions.  The intent is not to create original
and unique solutions, rather to practice working through
these algorithms and understand good implementations.
